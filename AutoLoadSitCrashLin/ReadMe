This folder contains the SDK Library, the C++ code, and the Makefile required to build, compile, and link the plugin for autoloading a situation file when the plane crashes and it exceeds a maximum g-force for the Linux operating system.

To make any changes to the maximum g-force, or any changes overall to the code, please follow these steps.

1.) Open up the "AutoLoadSitCrashLin.cpp" in a text editor and make any changes
2.) Save the file
3.) Open up the terminal and navigate to the "AutoLoadSitCrashLinux" directory
4.) (Optional but Recommended) Delete the build directory, as it contains the plugin from the previous build
5.) Type "make" into the command line
6.) A new "build" directory should be created. The plugin file (.xpl) should be in there under the name "AutoLoadSitCrashLin.xpl"
